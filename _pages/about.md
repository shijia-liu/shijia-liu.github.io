I am a 6th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu), working with [Prof. David A. Smith](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/). My research interests are in natural language processing, machine learning and computational social science, broadly speaking. Prior to coming to Northeastern, I received a master's degree in computer science at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) (where I worked with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/authors/ryan/) on quantifying the ideosyncrasies of Chinese classifiers), a master's degree in electrical engineering at [Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu), and bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and physics at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu).
